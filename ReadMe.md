# Arkes

Hi! The aim of Arkes is to create an email attachment downloading application! This will be downloading the specified apps and then allowing you to save the attachments in CSV/XLS/SQL format.

The hope of this is to make it a friendly universal app that can do the data collection, manipulation, and pushing!


# Features

This project is still in the infancy stage and will be forever evolving. At first it will be made for a specific type of attachment format but I hope to generalise this for other's use.
